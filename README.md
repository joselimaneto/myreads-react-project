# MyReads - A React Application for Registering Books.

This is a react project for registering books made for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal is to create a bookshelf application which allows users to register and classify books that they are reading, have read or want to read. The project emphasizes the use of ReactJS for creating the purposed application and uses a API server and a client library, so that the user can persist the data as he interacts with the application.

The project is part of my portfolio as a React Developer.
